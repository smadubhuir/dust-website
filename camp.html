<p>
  D.U.S.T. is a High Risk / Lobo Expectations Gathering Experience. This is a community art & music event — not a staffed festival. We welcome you to come camp with us, and to connect and reconnect through music and art under the stars.
</p>

<p>
  If you want something less rustic, there are affordable hotels in Van Horn and a full hookup RV park in Valentine.
</p>

<p><strong>RSVP:</strong> To help us prepare, please read the information below and RSVP for camping; update your RSVP should anything change. We will be using the RSVP list to email additional info regarding camping check-in, etc.</p>

<h2>High Risk</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Rattlesnakes, coyotes, tarantulas, cactus & other pokey plants.</li>
  <li>Dry & hot. Bring your own drinking water – bring ENOUGH drinking water. Our well water is potable but very salty.</li>
  <li>Dusty & windy. We have dust storms, thunderstorms and generally intense weather out here. Check the weather and come prepared for unpredictability.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lobo Expectations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>This is <strong>not</strong> glamping.</li>
  <li>Small RVs okay, no hookups</li>
  <li>If you’d like a quieter camping experience about a mile away, just let us
know in your RSVP.</li>
<li>We are off grid. With that said you can charge your small devices on the
porch during the day, but please no charging of large batteries.</li>
<li>Composting & flush toilets available.</li>
<li>Very limited rinse-off salt water solar shower available.</li> 
<li>Bring everything you need as if you were camping in the wilderness. This
includes a chair, shelter, food, cooking supplies. The closest store is 20
minutes away.</li> 
<li>Fill your cooler with ice in town.</li>
<li>You can cook on the grill or over the fire pit. If you’re a vegetarian, please
ask about the secret vegetarian-only grill. We have dish washing stations
with limited water.</li>
<li>We have a cell phone booster and WiFi.</li>
