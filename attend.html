<h1>Attend for the Day</h1>

<p><strong>BYO Chair</strong></p>

<p>
  Lobo Flats is located 9 miles from the Lobo Ghost Town on FM 2017 and two miles from Matthew Gray’s large scale aluminum sculptures.
  Cell service is patchy so screenshot the actual directions. Remember to fill up on gas and water before heading out.
  <strong>FYI:</strong> Border Patrol is very active in the area right now.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Directions from Van Horn (20 minutes)</li>
  <li>Directions from Valentine (25 minutes)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Lobo Flats is a desolate, dusty place. We’ve seen dust storms and one coyote this year. Be aware of rattlesnakes, tarantulas, scorpions, and extreme temperatures.
</p>

<p>
  Closest store: 20 minutes away in Van Horn. Valentine only has a bar (they do sell beer to go).
</p>

<p>
  Bring sunscreen, hat, water, and snacks. Come prepared for a half-day summer hike in sketchy weather.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>BYO Food & Drinks:</strong> Grills and a basic outdoor kitchen are available. Feel free to cook your own food.
</p>

<p>
  All ages welcome. Dogs and pets welcome. Please supervise your child/pet at all times.
