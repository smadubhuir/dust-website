<h2><i>Music & Art Schedule Coming Soon</i></h2>

<p>
  Lobo Flats is located 9 miles from the Lobo Ghost Town on FM 2017 and two miles from Matthew Gray’s large scale aluminum sculptures.
  Cell service is patchy so screenshot the actual directions. Remember to fill up on gas and water before heading out.
  <strong>FYI:</strong> Border Patrol is very active in the area right now.
</p>

<p>
  Lobo Flats is a desolate, dusty place. We’ve seen dust storms and one coyote this year. Be aware of rattlesnakes, tarantulas, scorpions, and extreme temperatures.
</p>

<p>
  Closest store: 20 minutes away in Van Horn. Valentine only has a bar (they do sell beer to go).
</p>

<p>
  Bring sunscreen, hat, water, and snacks. Come prepared for a half-day summer hike in sketchy weather.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>BYO Food & Drinks:</strong> Grills and a basic outdoor kitchen are available. Feel free to cook your own food.
</p>

  All ages welcome. Dogs and pets welcome. Please supervise your child/pet at all times.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Directions from Van Horn:</b><br>Head East on US-90 for 12 miles. Turn right onto FM
1523 at the tractor man sign, across from the green silos. After 5.4 miles, FM
1523 becomes FM 2017. Go another 4.6 miles on the pavement and the property
is on the right. Park along the road by the old cars.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Directions from Marfa/Valentine:</b><br>Take highway US-90 West, maybe 15 miles or
so past Valentine. Then take left on FM 2017 (a mile past rest stop at tractor man
sign). Then go three or four miles; veer right past Chispa Road/Old Quonset Hut.
Go another mile or so. Property is on the left. Park along the road by the old cars.
